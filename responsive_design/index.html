<h1> Literary Plagues </h1>

<h3>The Setting</h2>
<p>In 542 AD, at the height of Justinian’s campaign to restore the Roman Empire to its former borders and glories, plague struck Constantinople. Procopius described the brutal course of this outbreak in the city and its immediate surroundings, but he was not alone in his efforts. The plague, having emerged from Africa the year before, made its way around the Mediterranean, into Persia to the east and eventually into Gaul, Northern Europe and the British Isles, to the west. The disease recurred steadily until the mid-eighth century, striking as far east as China, and plaguing the rising armies of Islam to the south. As the epidemic spread, so too did writing about the plague.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> “The plague…fell upon the whole world; yet just as many people escaped as had the misfortune to succumb – either because they escaped the infection altogether, or because they got over it if they happened to be infected. But this man not a single person in the whole Roman Empire could escape: like any other visitation from heaven falling on the entire human race he left no one completely untouched. Some he killed without any justification; others he reduced to penury, making them even more wretched than those who had died.” (Procop. Hist. Arc. 6.22-24)</p>
</blockquote>
