<p>Constantinople was not the first city struck by the plague, but it is the one that left us the most complete account of the outbreak in the city. Written by Procopius, the author of several treatises on wars and infrastructure, the plague narrative that comes from Constantinople tracks the outbreak and its effect on society, using language that is highly reminiscent of Thucydides' earlier account of plague in Athens.</p>

<blockquote>Now the disease in Byzantium ran a course of four months, and its greatest virulence lasted about three. And at first the deaths were a little more than the normal, then the mortality rose still higher, and afterwards the tale of dead reached five thousand each day, and again it even came to ten thousand and still more than that. Now in the beginning each man attended to the burial of the dead of his own house, and these they threw even into the tombs of others, either escaping detection or using violence; but afterwards confusion and disorder everywhere became complete. For slaves remained destitute of masters, and men who in former times were very prosperous were deprived of the service of their domestics who were either sick or dead, and many houses became completely destitute of human inhabitants. For this reason it came about that some of the notable men of the city because of the universal destitution remained unburied for many days.
<br></br>
And it fell to the lot of the emperor, as was natural, to make provision for the trouble. He therefore detailed soldiers from the palace and distributed money, commanding Theodorus to take charge of this work; this man held the position of announcer of imperial messages, always announcing to the emperor the petitions of his clients, and declaring to them in turn whatever his wish was. In the Latin tongue the Romans designate this office by the term Referendarius. So those who had not as yet fallen into complete destitution in their domestic affairs attended individually to the burial of those connected with them. But Theodorus, by giving out the emperor's money and by making further expenditures from his own purse, kept burying the bodies which were not cared for. And when it came about that all the tombs which had existed previously were filled with the dead, then they dug up all the places about the city one after the other, laid the dead there, each one as he could, and departed; but later on those who were making these trenches, no longer able to keep up with the number of the dying, mounted the towers of the fortifications in Sycae [Galata], and tearing off the roofs threw the bodies there in complete disorder; and they piled them up just as each one happened to fall, and filled practically all the towers with corpses, and then covered them again with their roofs. As a result of this an evil stench pervaded the city and distressed the inhabitants still more, and especially whenever the wind blew fresh from that quarter. - Procopius, <em>History of the Wars</em>.</blockquote>

<p>Evagriusâ€™ narrative of the plague is the most personal extant report; he survived a personal experience with the plague (much like Thucydides) but lost many members of his family. As an aide to Gregory, Evagrius was at the heart of the same outbreak that drove the Pope to give his speech to the people of Rome, and his chronicle is quite weighted by his profession and his belief. The plague appears in his text outside of the main narrative to describe the origins of a plague saint (Thomas) believed to have ended an occurrence of the disease with his death. Evagrius was living in Rome when he wrote his chronicle, but the events he cites occurred in Antioch during the reign of Justinian.

<blockquote>Thus it happened in my own case--for I deem it fitting, in due adaptation of circumstances, to insert also in this history matters relating to myself--that at the commencement of this calamity I was seized with what are termed buboes, while still a school-boy, and lost by its recurrence at different times several of my children, my wife, and many of my kin, as well as of my domestic and country servants; the several indictions making, as it were, a distribution of my misfortunes. - Evagrius, <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>.</blockquote>
