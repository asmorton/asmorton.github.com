<p> Scholarly research on the Justinianic plague is difficult to characterize. Much of the focus has been either regional, or dedicated to uncovering the origin of the plague. Additionally, most historians working in this period have dedicated some amount of time and writing space to tracking down the bacteriological culprit. This section will look at a sample of this literature.</p>

<h3><a name="Origins">Origins</a></h3>
<p> The origins and effects of the disease have been hotly contested in recent scholarship perhaps due to its similarity to the plague of the fourteenth century that followed a similar track, had a nearly identical epidemiology, and had a significant impact on the political and economic realities of the later Middle Ages.</p>
<p> Peter Sarris argues for an African origin to the plague, despite suggestive evidence for an Indian origin, on the basis of continuous contact with Ethiopia during the wars between Byzantium and Persia. Alternative origins have been suggested. Michael McCormick is working on the problem from the vector standpoint, examining the remains of plague victims and black rats.</p>

<h3><a name="Path">Path</a></h3>
<p> The path of the plague is fairly clear from the sources that survive. In 541, the plague appeared in Pelusium, then made its way into Alexandria, then deeper into Egypt and Palestine. By 542, the plague had made it into Constantinople, providing fodder for Procopius, then into Evagrius' Antioch, then to Illyricum, Africa, and Spain. In 543, the plague, or one like it, arrived in Atropatene, Italy, Gaul, and the British Isles.</p>

<h3><a name="Pathology">Pathology</a></h3>
<p> The reason this plague is generally not assumed to be a collection of different diseases is due to the consistent descriptions of its symptoms. While in some cases, particularly in the north, 'plague' might actually mean smallpox or something similar, most of the longer plague narratives discuss the appearance of 'buboes' upon infection. Bubonic plague, then, would seem to be the culprit. Additionally, the spread of this plague and that of the later Black Death is, to some extent, fairly similar.</p>
